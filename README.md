This project entails the development of an IT strategy through a comprehensive analysis of the existing IT and Business Strategy of an Electric Vehicle organization. The endeavor involved an in-depth examination of the company's historical evolution, current strategies, pain points, inefficiencies, and notably, unsuccessful supply chain processes. The project's core objective was to formulate an innovative strategy by offering viable solutions, implementing enhancements, and identifying avenues for overall improvement.

The process involved a series of carefully executed tasks, including:

• Research and Problem Identification: A meticulous assessment of the EV company's prevailing IT and Business Strategy was conducted, highlighting inherent challenges and issues. This phase aimed to identify areas requiring strategic intervention.

• Strategy Development and Problem Resolution: Drawing upon the insights gained from the research phase, a new strategic framework was conceptualized. This framework was designed to address the previously identified challenges, with detailed solutions proposed to alleviate existing problems.

• Process Analysis and Enhancement: An exhaustive analysis of the company's existing processes was undertaken, dissecting pain points and inefficiencies inherent in the As-Is state. Subsequently, a meticulously refined and improved business and IT process, aligning with the organization's strategic objectives, was formulated (To-Be state). This transformation aimed to rectify the previously identified issues.

• Strategic Decision-Making Tools Application: Strategic decision-making tools, such as Porter's Five Forces analysis, SWOT analysis, Ansoff matrix, BCG matrix, and Application Portfolio Analysis, were harnessed to facilitate informed decision-making. These tools played a pivotal role in guiding the strategic direction of the organization.

• Innovative Business Enhancements: Innovative concepts were introduced to drive business improvements, including the integration of after-sales services, harnessing cloud technology, and the optimal utilization of supply chain analytics. These ideas were aligned with modern trends and the organization's growth objectives.

• Market and Demand Analysis: A thorough market analysis and demand assessment were executed to ascertain the target market. This phase provided valuable insights into customer preferences and demands, guiding the strategic positioning of the organization.

• Process Visualization: To offer a comprehensive view of the envisaged after-sales service, detailed process flowcharts and process flow diagrams were meticulously crafted. These visual aids aimed to provide a clear and concise representation of the proposed higher-level business concept.

In summary, this project revolved around the strategic overhaul of the IT and Business Strategy of an Electric Vehicle organization. It encompassed research, problem identification, strategy development, process enhancement, utilization of strategic decision-making tools, introduction of innovative business ideas, market analysis, and visual representation of proposed processes.
